(Q) Content Delivery Network (CDN)
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a system of distributed servers that work together to deliver web content such as images, videos, stylesheet, and scripts to user based on their geographical locations. The primary goal of CDN is to improve the performance and reliability of web services by reducing latency and increase the speed of content delivery.
Benefits:
•	Improving website load time
•	Reducing bandwidth cost
•	Increasing content availability and redundancy
•	Improving website security
How CDN works:
1. Content Distribution: When you use a CDN, your web content is distributed across multiple servers located in different geographical locations. These servers are often referred to as "edge servers" or "nodes."
2. Caching: The CDN caches static content, like images and stylesheets, on these edge servers. When a user requests a particular piece of content, the CDN delivers it from the nearest edge server instead of the origin server where the website is hosted.
3. Geographic Distribution: CDNs have servers strategically placed in various locations worldwide. This reduces the physical distance between the user and the server, leading to faster loading times and improved performance.
4. Load Balancing: CDNs use load balancing algorithms to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers. This ensures that no single server bears too much load, improving overall reliability and preventing server overload.
5. Distributed Security: CDNs can provide an additional layer of security by protecting websites from certain types of cyber-attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
6. Optimization: CDNs often include optimization features like image compression, minification of CSS and JavaScript files, and other techniques to further enhance the speed and performance of websites.
Popular CDN providers include Cloudflare, Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, and others. Website owners and developers use CDNs to accelerate the delivery of content, improve user experience, and ensure that their websites can handle traffic spikes effectively.
